# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

Repository overview

- This repository is a Mintlify documentation site. The root docs.json defines site navigation and settings. Content pages are authored in MDX under docs/ folder structure (for example: docs/mintlify/ai-tools/, docs/mintlify/essentials/). The API Reference is driven by docs/mintlify/api-reference/openapi.json and can be supplemented by MDX endpoint pages in docs/mintlify/api-reference/endpoint/.
- Navigation is auto-generated from directory structure using `pnpm run index` script. Tab and group names are configurable via YAML files.
- Local development and validation are performed via the Mintlify CLI (mint). Deployment is typically managed by Mintlify's GitHub App from your Mintlify dashboard and auto-deploys on pushes to the default branch (per README).

Common commands
Prerequisites

- Ensure Node.js is installed.
- This project uses pnpm as package manager. Install dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

- Install or update the Mintlify CLI globally:

```
npm i -g mint
# If needed, update to latest
npm i -g mint@latest
# Or update via CLI
mint update
```

Local preview

- Run from the repository root (where docs.json is located):

```
pnpm dev
# Preview runs at http://localhost:3000
# Customize port if needed
pnpm preview
```

Navigation management

- Auto-generate navigation from directory structure:

```
pnpm run index
```

- Configure tab names in `docs/tabs.yml`
- Configure group names in `docs/[directory]/groups.yml`

API reference and validations

- Validate your OpenAPI file:

```
pnpm run check
```

Content management helpers

- Check for broken relative links in your docs:

```
mint broken-links
```

- Safely rename a file and auto-update internal references:

```
mint rename <oldFilename> <newFilename>
```

- If migrating endpoint MDX pages to OpenAPI-generated pages (optional, only if you choose to consolidate):

```
mint migrate-mdx
```

Architecture and structure

- docs.json (root): The single source of truth for navigation and high-level settings. Navigation is auto-generated by `pnpm run index` script.
- Content (MDX pages): Organized under docs/ folder by thematic folders (e.g., docs/mintlify/ai-tools/, docs/mintlify/essentials/). Each .mdx page maps to a route.
- Configuration files:
  - docs/tabs.yml: Defines tab names
  - docs/[directory]/groups.yml: Defines group names for each directory
- API Reference: docs/mintlify/api-reference/openapi.json provides the underlying API schema. The docs/mintlify/api-reference/endpoint/*.mdx files provide additional examples.
- Scripts: scripts/generate-navigation.js automatically scans directory structure and updates docs.json navigation.

Deployment (from README)

- Install the Mintlify GitHub App from your Mintlify dashboard to connect this repo. Changes pushed to the default branch are deployed automatically.

Notes and troubleshooting

- Always run commands from the repository root so the CLI can detect docs.json.
- Use pnpm for all package management and script execution.
- Run `pnpm run index` after adding/removing/moving files to update navigation.
- If the local preview doesn't match expected behavior, ensure the CLI is current (mint update or npm i -g mint@latest).
- Development is content-first via the Mintlify CLI with automated navigation generation.
